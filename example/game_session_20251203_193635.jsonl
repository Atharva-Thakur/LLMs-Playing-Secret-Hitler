David discards 1, enacts 1.\n    *   **Possible outcomes if elected:**\n        *   If Charlie (L) and David (L/S, but not MS): Charlie would discard Red, pass [Blue, Blue]. David would be forced to enact Blue, and Loyalists win.\n        *   If Charlie (S) and David (L, but not MS): Charlie could discard Blue, pass [Red, Blue].

It avoids the immediate loss condition and gives us another chance to form a government, hopefully with more information or a more trustworthy Chancellor.\n    *   Given the high stakes (instant Spy win vs. potential instant Loyalist win), the Loyalist priority must be to *prevent the instant Spy victory*. I cannot take the chance that David is the Master Spy.\n\n2.  **Strategy:**\n    *   My immediate goal is to prevent the Spies from winning immediately by electing the Master Spy as Chancellor.\n    *   Therefore, I must vote 'Nein' for any government where I cannot be certain the Chancellor is not the Master Spy, especially under the 3+ Red Protocol condition.\n    *   I need to communicate my reasoning to other Loyalists to encourage similar caution.\n\n3.  **Plan:**\n    *   Vote 'Nein'.\n    *   Publicly state that the vote is out of caution due to the 3 enacted Red Protocols and the instant win condition for Spies if the Master Spy becomes Chancellor."}}
