The Election Tracker is at 1/3, meaning if this government fails, it will advance to 2/3. If another government then fails, a Red Protocol will be enacted automatically, which is bad for Loyalists. President Charlie has nominated Nina as Chancellor. I have no specific information or past actions to judge the trustworthiness of either Charlie or Nina. I don't know who was responsible for the single Red Protocol that has been enacted.\n2.  **Strategy:** As a Loyalist, I need to gather information. Voting 'Nein' without any specific reason to distrust Charlie or Nina would simply advance the Election Tracker, putting us closer to a forced Red Protocol, and would not give us any information about their loyalties. Voting 'Ja' allows the government to form. If they are Loyalists, they will enact a Blue Protocol, which helps my team. If they are Spies, they will likely enact a Red Protocol, but this provides valuable information on who to target in future rounds. Given the lack of information and the risk of advancing the Election Tracker unnecessarily, allowing the government to form seems like the most logical path to gain information and avoid a worse outcome (forced Red Protocol).\n3.  **Plan:** Vote 'Ja' to allow the government to form and observe their actions."}}

My goal is to enact a Blue Protocol.\n2.  **Strategy:** My immediate goal is to nominate a Chancellor who I believe will help enact a Blue Protocol. Since I have no prior information, I must make an educated guess. If I choose a Loyalist, we can get a Blue. If I choose a Spy, they might enact a Red, but then they become highly suspicious. I need to take a chance. I will pick one of the eligible players and observe the voting and the policy outcome carefully. This early in the game, a nomination often serves to gather information about voting patterns and potential allegiances based on the policy enacted.\n3.  **Plan:** I will nominate one of the eligible players. Since there's no strategic advantage to picking one over the other without information, I will pick Charlie. I will state my nomination clearly and express hope for a successful government."}}

The Election Tracker is at 0/3, so we can afford for it to advance without immediately triggering a crisis. Enacting another Red Protocol (bringing it to 3/6) would be a significant setback for the Loyalists at this stage. Approving a P/C pair blindly without any information, especially after Spies have already shown success, is risky.\n2.  **Strategy:** As a Loyalist, my goal is to enact Blue Protocols and identify Spies. Blindly trusting a P/C pair when Spies have already enacted policies is not a good strategy. I need to be cautious. The cost of a 'Nein' vote (Election Tracker moves to 1/3) is low compared to the potential cost of a 'Ja' vote (another Red Protocol). I should voice my caution and justify my vote.\n3.  **Plan:** Vote 'Nein'.

She can attempt to enact a Red Protocol, or at the very least, influence the protocol deck. There's no strategic benefit for me, as a Spy, to vote 'Nein' in this situation. Voting 'Nein' would only advance the Election Tracker, which could benefit Spies in the long run by auto-enacting a Red Protocol, but an immediate win is far superior. I should support any government that includes a known Spy as Chancellor.\n3.  **Plan:** Vote 'Ja' to support the nomination of my fellow Spy, Alice, as Chancellor.
